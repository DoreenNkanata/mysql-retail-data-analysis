# mysql-retail-data-analysis
This project explores sales, customers, inventory, and staff performance from a retail database using MySQL. It involves SQL querying, performance tracking, and business insights simulating what a real-world data analyst would uncover for a company.

Project Objective
To derive actionable insights from a transactional retail database using SQL queries and later visualize them in Power BI.

Tools & Technologies
SQL (MySQL Workbench)

Power BI (for dashboarding)

Git & GitHub (for version control and portfolio showcase)

### **Database Overview**
The database consists of multiple normalized tables:

customers

orders

order_items

products

categories

staffs

stores

stocks

These tables simulate a multi-store retail operation.
